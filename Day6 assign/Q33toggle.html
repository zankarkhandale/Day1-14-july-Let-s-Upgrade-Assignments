            Cryogenic originated from two Greek word “Kyros” which means cold or freezing “gene”
             which means burn or produced 
             Cryogenic is the study of production of very low temperature nearly about ‘123 k’
              in which the material behavior and properties are studied at that temperature. 
            Cryogenic engine is a type of rocket engine designed to use the fuel or oxidizer
            which must be refrigerated to remain in liquid state .
            Liquid propellant Rocket engine(LPRE) are commonly used in space technology.
            Thrust chamber is one of the most important subsystem of a rocket engine. 
            The liquid propellant (i.e.…liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen) are metered,
            injected, atomized, vaporized, mixed and burned to form hot reaction gas product, 
            which in turned are accelerated and ejected at supersonic velocity . 
            Payload capacity of the space vehicle can be increased with the propulsion system having higher specific
            impulse, in general liquid propellant engines result in longer burning time than
            conventional solid rocket engine which result in higher
